# Framebuffers 🚀

<p>The sole purpose of this program is to demonstrate how framebuffers work in OpenGL, and how to do cool stuff with them 😲</p>
<p>Here, I've added some kernel effects to the engine. ✨</p>
<p>There is a lot more you can do with kernels, you can create your own effects and so. The only limit is your imagination. 😉</p>


## Screenshots 📷
### For this engine, I've used the sharpen kernel, mostly because I think it's cool 💁‍♂️
